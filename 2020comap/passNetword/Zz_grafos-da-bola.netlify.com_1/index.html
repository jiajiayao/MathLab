            Centralidade de grau é definida como o número de ligações incidentes
            de um vértice. O grau pode ser interpretado como a probabilidade que
            o vértice tem de receber alguma informação da rede.

            No caso de uma rede orientada (onde os laços tem direção), define-se
            duas medidas distintas de centralidade de grau: indegree e

            direcionadas para o nó e outdegree é o número de ligações que o nó

                Perhaps the simplest centrality measure in a network is just the
                degree of a vertex, the number of edges connected to it (see
                Section 6.9). Degree is sometimes called degree centrality in
                the social networks literature, to emphasize its use as a
                centrality measure. In directed networks, vertices have both an
                in-degree and an out-degree, and both may be useful as measures
                of centrality in the appropriate circumstances.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although degree centrality is a simple centrality measure, it
                can be very illuminating. In a social network, for instance, it
                seems reasonable to suppose that individuals who have
                connections to many others might have more influence, more
                access to information, or more prestige than those who have
                fewer connections. A non-social network example is the use of
                citation counts in the evaluation of scientific papers. The
                number of citations a paper receives from other papers, which is
                simply its in-degree in the citation network, gives a crude
                measure of whether the paper has been influential or not and is
                widely used as a metric for judging the impact of scientific
                research.

                A natural extension of the simple degree centrality is
                eigenvector centrality. We can think of degree centrality as
                awarding one “centrality point” for every network neighbor a
                vertex has. But not all neighbors are equivalent. In many
                circumstances a vertex’s importance in a network is increased by
                having connections to other vertices that are themselves
                important. This is the concept behind eigenvector centrality.
                Instead of awarding vertices just one point for each neighbor,
                eigenvector centrality gives each vertex a score proportional to
                the sum of the scores of its neighbors.

                In theory eigenvector centrality can be calculated for either
                undirected or directed networks. It works best however for the
                undirected case. In the directed case other complications arise.
                First of all, a directed network has an adjacency matrix that
                is, in general, asymmetric (see Section 6.4). This means that it
                has two sets of eigenvectors, the left eigenvectors and the
                right eigenvectors, and hence two leading eigenvectors. So which
                of the two should we use to define the centrality? In most cases
                the correct answer is to use the right eigenvector. The reason
                is that centrality in directed networks is usually bestowed by
                other vertices pointing towards you, rather than by you pointing
                to others. On the World Wide Web, for instance, the number and
                stature of web pages that point to your page can give a
                reasonable indication of how important or useful your page is.
                On the other hand, the fact that your page might point to other
                important pages is neither here nor there. Anyone can set up a
                page that points to a thousand others, but that does not make
                the page important.

                Some other variations on the betweenness centrality idea are
                worth mentioning. Betweenness gets at an important idea in
                network analysis, that of the flow of information or other
                traffic and of the influence vertices might have over that flow.
                However, betweenness as defined by Freeman is based on counting
                only the shortest paths between vertex pairs, effectively
                assuming that all or at least most traffic passes along those
                shortest paths. In reality traffic flows along paths other than
                the shortest in many networks. Most of us, for instance, will

                acquaintance—the message has passed along a path of length two
                via the mutual acquaintance, rather than along the direct
                (geodesic) path of length one. A version of betweenness
                centrality that makes some allowance for effects like this is
                the flow betweenness, which was proposed by Freeman et al. and
                is based on the idea of maximum flow. Imagine each edge in a
                network as a pipe that can carry a unit flow of some fluid. We
                can ask what the maximum possible flow then is between a given
                source vertex s and target vertex t through these pipes. In
                general the answer is that more than a single unit of flow can
                be carried between source and target by making simultaneous use
                of several different paths through the network.

                In terms of our information analogy, one can think of flow
                betweenness as measuring the betweenness of vertices in a
                network in which a maximal amount of information is continuously
                pumped between all sources and targets. Flow betweenness takes
                account of more than just the geodesic paths between vertices,
                since flow can go along non-geodesic paths as well as geodesic
                ones. (For example, the paths through vertices A and B in the
                example above are not geodesic.) Indeed, in some cases none of
                the paths that appear in the solution of the maximum flow
                problem are geodesic paths, so geodesic paths may not be counted
                at all by this measure. But this point highlights a problem with
                flow betweenness: although it typically counts more paths than
                the standard shortest-path betweenness, flow betweenness still
                only counts a subset of possible paths, and some important ones
                (such as geodesic paths) may be missed out altogether. One way
                to look at the issue is that both shortest-path betweenness and
                flow betweenness assume flows that are optimal in some
                sense—passing only along shortest paths in the first case and
                maximizing total flow in the second. Just as there is no reason
                to suppose that information or other traffic always takes the
                shortest path, there is no reason in general to suppose it
                should act to maximize flow (although of course there may be
                special cases in which it does). (...) A betweenness variant
                that does count all paths is the random-walk betweenness. In
                this variant traffic between vertices s and t is thought of as
                performing an (absorbing) random walk that starts at vertex s
                and continues un til it reaches vertex t. (...) Random walk
                betweenness would be an appropriate betweenness measure for
                traffic that traverses a network with no idea of where it is
                going—it simply wanders around at random until it reaches its
                destination. Shortest-path betweenness is the exact opposite. It
                is the appropriate measure for information that knows exactly
                where it is going and takes the most direct path to get there.
                It seems likely that most real-world situations fall somewhere
                in between these two extremes. However, it is found in practice
                that the two measures often give quite similar results, in which
                case one can with reasonable justification assume that the
                “correct” answer, the one lying between the limits set by the
                shortest-path and random-walk measures, is similar to both.

                (...) local clustering can be used as a probe for the existence
                of so-called 'structural holes' in a network. While it is common
                in many networks, especially social networks, for the neighbors
                of a vertex to be connected among themselves, it happens
                sometimes that these expected connections between neighbors are
                missing. The missing links are called structural holes and were
                first studied in this context by Burt. If we are interested in
                efficient spread of information or other traffic around a
                network, as we were in Section 7.7, then structural holes are a
                bad thing— they reduce the number of alternative routes
                information can take through the network. On the other hand
                structural holes can be a good thing for the central vertex i
                whose friends lack connections, because they give i power over
                information flow between those friends. If two friends of i are
                not connected directly and their information about one another
                comes instead via their mutual connection with i then i can
                control the flow of that information. The local clustering
                coefficient measures how influential i is in this sense, taking
                lower values the more structural holes there are in the network
                around i. Thus local clustering can be regarded as a type of
                centrality measure, albeit one that takes small values for
                powerful individuals rather than large ones.

                In this sense, local clustering can also be thought of as akin
                to the betweenness centrality of Section 7.7. Where betweenness
                measures a vertex’s control over information flowing between all
                pairs of vertices in its component, local clustering is like a
                local version of betweenness that measures control over flows
                between just the immediate neighbors of a vertex. One measure is
                not necessarily better than another. There may be cases in which
                we want to take all vertices into account and others where we
                want to consider only immediate neighbors—the choice will depend
                on the particular questions we want to answer. It is worth
                pointing out however that betweenness is much more
                computationally intensive to calculate than local clustering
                (see Section 10.3.6), and that in practice betweenness and local
